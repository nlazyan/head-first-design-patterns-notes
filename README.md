**Personal notes and code examples from the book Head First Design Patterns by Eric Freeman & Elisabeth Freeman.**

## About This Repository

This repository is a **personal study project** where I summarize the concepts from the book and provide small code examples for each design pattern.  
It is **not an official source**â€”all notes and code are my own learning material.
